## üìù Overview

This repository is designed to document my journey in learning **React** through daily practice and project building. The training focuses on mastering key React concepts like components, state, props, hooks, routing, and API integration while utilizing **Vite** for efficient development.

Whether you're a frontend developer, full-stack developer, or React enthusiast, this repository provides a solid foundation in React development with practical projects and exercises.

## ‚ö° React + Vite

The **React** and **Vite** setup in this repository ensures a fast and modern development experience. **Vite**'s minimal setup and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) allow for quicker iterations, making it a great choice for React applications.

Here are the available Vite plugins for React development :

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed :

- **Node.js and npm**: Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **React Developer Tools**: Install this extension in your browser for better development experience.

To verify your Node.js installation, run :

```bash
node --version
```

## üí¨ Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps :

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
